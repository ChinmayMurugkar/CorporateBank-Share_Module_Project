# CorporateBank-Share_Module_Project

Objective
The Motto behind the share module software is to maintain the records of the shareholders of
the co-operative bank and perform the dividend calculations in the back end in better way 
for the co-operative bank by endorsing the functioning platform of the bank module for dealing 
with the personal information of the shareholders and getting a fair share of dividend amount in 
a better and efficient way to each of the shareholders.

Basic Idea
This technique is more time and cost effective in terms of manpower involved instead of the manual method. 
This is so because when the work of the co-operative bank is carried out using papers and manual calculations,
it requires lots of time to carry out the complete database maintenance and dividend calculations of the co-operative 
bank manually and it is also very tedious to maintain the record of the earlier transactions of each and every shareholder. 
As soon as the system is automated and implemented using software, it becomes very easy to maintain the previous sessions 
by creating a backup. The bank staff can fill up the form for the shareholderâ€™s data entry, and as only the authorised 
bank personnel is allowed to carry out this process, there is no need for extra supervision on part of the administrator.
Since the software is being developed for the Co-operative Bank, it has to deal with the calculations that 
are basically handled by the cooperative bank. Dividends are payments made by a bank to its shareholder members. 
Now these can be illustrated in lucid way with the help of a co-operative bank with five shareholders. 
Now let us consider that they have invested for building up a 

Platform:
The Share Module is the system which works on the platform of the database storage of 
the shareholders of the bank and shares which are been allotted to each of the member
with help of the calculated or declared dividend in percent. The database is being managed 
in ORACLE 10g. Here in, the information of the co-operative bank shareholder is being stored, 
which is further discussed in detail in chapter
. The data is stored and retrieved through the front end user interface 
(UI) provided which has been designed in ORACLE Forms 6i,
